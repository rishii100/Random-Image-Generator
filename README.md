# Random-Image-Generator:
This code generates ramdom images.

## Prerequisite modules:
`` pip install Pillow ``

## Steps:
 The code starts by importing the Image and random modules.
 The code then creates a new image with dimensions of 640x480 pixels.
 Next, it loads the image into memory using the load() method from PIL's Image module.
 It then iterates through each pixel in the image to create a random color value between 0 and 255 for each pixel.
 The next line saves the newly created image to disk as "random_image.png".
 The code is used to generate a random image.
 The code creates an Image object with the dimensions of 640x480 pixels.
 The next step in the code is to load the image into memory and then iterate through every pixel on the screen, assigning each pixel a random value between 0 and 255.
